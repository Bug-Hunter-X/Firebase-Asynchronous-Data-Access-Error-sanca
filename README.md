# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications: attempting to access data before it's fully loaded from the database. The `bug.js` file shows incorrect code that leads to an error, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.

## Problem

When working with Firebase's asynchronous operations (like `once()` or `on()`), it's crucial to ensure that the data has been fetched before accessing it.  Premature access results in errors such as `Cannot read properties of undefined`. 

## Solution

The solution involves properly handling the asynchronous nature of Firebase data retrieval.  Always check for the existence of data before accessing properties to prevent errors.
