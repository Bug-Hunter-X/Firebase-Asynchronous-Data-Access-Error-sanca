The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access data before it's fully loaded. This often happens when you try to read data from a listener or promise before the listener has been triggered or the promise has been resolved.  For example:

```javascript
// Incorrect - accessing data before it's loaded
db.ref('users').once('value').then(snapshot => {
  console.log(snapshot.val().name); // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
});
```

This occurs because `snapshot.val()` might return `null` or `undefined` if the data hasn't loaded yet.
